# Traffic Phase Engine
#### Simulation
The project is built as a CLI application that simulates an intelligent intersection. It takes an input.json file containing a list of traffic events or commands and generates an output.json reflecting the system’s decisions.

#### Background
Some time ago, I applied for an internship and received a recruitment task to build a simulation of an intelligent traffic intersection. I managed to complete the fullstack app on time, but unfortunately, it didn’t meet the expectations of the recruitment team.

Despite that, I received detailed feedback and a solid code review, which I truly appreciated. Taking all that constructive criticism into account, I decided to start this project from scratch. This time, with the experience I gained, I aimed to deliver it to 100%.

Unlike the previous attempt, this version won’t be reviewed by anyone — it’s a personal challenge to fully deliver the project and test my skills across the board: from system architecture and algorithm design to applying the right data structures and development best practices.

My original attempt was written in TypeScript and can be seen here: [link](https://github.com/jzielinski47/intelligent-traffic-control).
